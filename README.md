# WarriorJS Solutions

[WarriorJS](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs) (by [olistic](https://github.com/olistic)) is a CLI game where the player needs to write an Artificial Intelligence using JavaScript in order to climb a tower full of challenges.

This is a repository of my own solutions (so far) for the levels of the game.

Navigate through the different branches of the repository to view the solution for each level.
